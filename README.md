# fpga-verilog-blackjack
## Blackjack implementation in Verilog HDL
Digital System Design university project on Xilinx Spartan-3E FPGA development board written in Verilog HDL using ISE WebPACK design software. The games results are shown on the LCD screen and the game is played using the push buttons on the board. Detailed documentation about used modules, tests, working principle and game logic are written in Croatian under "PDS_izvjestaj". The game logic is designed to be an FSM (Finite State Machine).
